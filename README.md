# state-swapper
Takes a wordlist and identifies all entries that form
another entry when two letters are swapped, i.e. a state
postal code from states.txt. Only selecting for inner
word transformations can be toggled in quant_state_filter.py.
Min score and length can be toggled in list_generator.py.

Intended for state postal codes but could be used for any list
of swapping letters of any length, even if lengths do not match.
